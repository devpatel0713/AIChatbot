# AI Chatbot (Angular)

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built with **Angular**.  
It allows users to send prompts to different AI providers — **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, or a built-in **Demo API** — and view AI-generated responses.

## Features
- Switch between **Demo**, **OpenAI**, and **Hugging Face** providers  
- Enter custom **API keys** for OpenAI or Hugging Face  
- Submit chat prompts and receive responses in real time  
- Demo mode for testing without API keys  
- Form validation (e.g., requires a minimum 3-character prompt)

## Tech Stack
- **Angular** (standalone components, Reactive Forms)
